(The file `/Users/Shared/projects/mjh2901/readme_hidden.md` exists, but is empty)
This repository contains the source for the website mikehathaway.com â€” a Jekyll site deployed automatically via GitHub Actions.

Note: The file `README.md` in this repository is used as the GitHub profile README for the user `mjh2901` (Mike Hathaway) and should be treated separately from the Jekyll site source. The rest of the repository holds the site's content and configuration; builds and deployments are handled by GitHub Actions on each push.
